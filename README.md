# Burger-Time

### Overview
It's Burger Time! Eat-Da-Burger is a restaurant application that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. Eat-Da-Burger is a  burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page. The application will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
